## Design Philosophy

MacroVox adopts a **futuristic, minimalist aesthetic** inspired by *The Expanse* MCRN aesthetic. The design prioritizes:
- **Clarity**: Bold color contrasts and clean typography
- **Functionality**: Optimized for voice-first workflows
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Strategic use of cyan, red, and neutral tones

See `STYLE_GUIDE.md` in the root for complete design specifications.

## Color Palette

- **Cyan/Teal** (`#00d4aa`, `#00ffff`) - Primary accent, energy, action
- **Dark Navy** (`#0a0e27`) - Primary background, depth
- **Bright Red** (`#ff3333`, `#ff6b35`) - Alerts, recording state
- **Purple** (`#9d4edd`) - Secondary accent
- **Gold/Yellow** (`#ffd60a`) - Tertiary accent

## Future Additions

- Wireframes for Phase 2+ features
- DeepGram integration mockups
- Mobile/tablet responsive layouts
- Light mode design variations
